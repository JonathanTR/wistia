  <h1>Hi!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm glad you clicked. I know, I'm totally cheating on the 150 character limit, and I feel really bad about that, but here is something interesting about me:
  </p>
  <p>
    I really dig obscure forms of poetry. Following is an embarrassing video I made last summer as an application to Dev Bootcamp. In it, I'll tell you how to write a double dactyl, why I love programming, and how those two things relate.
  </p>
  <p>
    To know what's really interesting about me though, you'd have to spend some time with me. I'll be in Boston this weekend and I would love to meet you. <a href="mailto:jonathan.d.reilly@gmail.com">Let me know.</a>
